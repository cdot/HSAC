The programs in this directory are low level tests for probing GPIO input pins
and reading sensors attached to them.

Use "make" to build the C-code tests.

<pin> is a BCM pin number

read_gpio.py <pin>      - Python program to read GPIO using RPi.GPIO

make read_gpio
./read_gpio <pin>       - C program to read GPIO using wiringPi

node read_gpio.js <pin> - JS program to read GPIO using raspi-gpio
make read_dht

./read_dht <pin>        - C program to read DHT connected to GPIO

node readTimer.js <pin> - report number of ms that a pin is high between
                          samples taken every 1/2s. Test for the "Timer" sensor.
