<h1 id="sheds">Sheds</h1>
<p>Custom application for managing a dive club&#39;s resources. The application was
written specifically for use by Hartford Sub-Aqua Club, and reflects the way
we organise and manage our resources.</p>
<p>The application comprises three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>A browser application</li>
<li>A read-write cache server</li>
<li>An online database of read-only data</li>
</ol>
<ul data-toc data-toc-headings="h2,h3,h4"></ul>

<h2 id="browser-application">Browser Application</h2>
<p>The application user interface is written to use a standard
browser. This provides a high degree of portability and openness. The
browser application presents a tab interface, where each tab offers a
particular service:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compressor - recording compressor usage with tracking of filter lifetime</li>
<li>Loans - recording of equipment loans with complete editable history
and cross-links to inventory</li>
<li>Inventory - equipment records</li>
<li>Nitrox - nitrox blending calculations</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="compressor">Compressor</h3>
<p>Compressor filter performance degrades significantly at higher
temperatures, so the temperature is recorded with the runtime to
maintain a running estimate of remaining lifetime. Filter performance
degradation follows a curve published by compressor manufacturers,
which is modelled by a symmetric sigmoidal curve
<code>F = D + (A - D) / (1 + (T / C) ^ B)</code> where T is the
temperature, F is a degradation factor, and A, B, C and D are
constants. The default constants are derived from the data provided by
Coltri for an MCH 16/ET, using <a href="http://mycurvefit.com">http://mycurvefit.com</a>, for a maximum
lifetime of 40 hours at 20&deg;C, though you can provide your own
coefficients to match your compressor/filters in the settings
(accessed using the gear icon on the top right).</p>
<h3 id="loans">Loans</h3>
<p>Outgoing loans are recorded by selection from the inventory. Loan
returns are recorded aginst the name of the person receiving back the
kit. The <code>Inventory</code> tab is automatically updated to reflect kit that
is out on loan.</p>
<h3 id="inventory">Inventory</h3>
<p>The inventory tab provides a way to quickly look up and find the
location of equipment.</p>
<h3 id="nitrox">Nitrox</h3>
<p>The calculations necessary for simple nitrox fills are performed using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_equation">Van der Waal&#39;s real gas equation</a> to make accurate predictions.</p>
<h2 id="cache-server">Cache Server</h2>
<p>Persistant storage is provided by using a cache server. Data files
from the read-only database are cached in this server. If the server
is hosted on the same network as the client, the user interface can
work even when an internet connection is not available. Use of a
network server also allows other mobile devices to read and write the
cache.</p>
<p>Included in the distribution is an interface suitable for using a
WebDAV server as the cache server. It would be easy to write an
interface to a different store provider, should you want to do so.</p>
<h3 id="using-a-webdav-server">Using a WebDAV server</h3>
<p>It&#39;s easy to set up a WebDAV server, even on a mobile device. We
recommend lighttpd on platforms that support it. On mobile devices,
HTTP Server powered by Apache by Tautvydas Andrikys is easy to set up
and configure. Note that your WebDAV server must support CORS.</p>
<p>For example, you might configure an Apache server on Linux as follows:</p>
<pre><code>DavLockDB /var/www/html/webdav/DavLockDB

# Add a rewrite to respond with a 200 SUCCESS on every OPTIONS request.
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} OPTIONS
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1 [R=200,L]

&lt;Location /webdav&gt;
  # CORS
  Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin &quot;*&quot;
  # These are just the methods used by Sheds
  Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Methods &quot;GET, OPTIONS, PUT, PROPFIND, MKCOL&quot;
  Header always set Access-Control-Max-Age &quot;1000&quot;
  Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers &quot;x-requested-with, Content-Type, origin, authorization, accept, client-security-token, depth, cache-control&quot;

  Dav On
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName &quot;Login required&quot;

  AuthUserFile &quot;/var/www/html/webdav/.passwd&quot;
  Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;</code></pre><p>You will need to provide the URL of your cache server to the user interface.</p>
<h3 id="capturing-data">Capturing data</h3>
<p>Collected data (the loan history and compressor log) is stored as .csv
files in the webdav server. These files can be accessed via webdav for
further analysis (e.g. download, or upload to Google Drive)</p>
<h2 id="read-only-database">Read-only Database</h2>
<p>The basic database for the application is read-only data that is
accessible through URLs that point to CSV documents. Access to the
database is via a single <code>index</code> URL which has to be manually provided
to the user interface. The app doesn&#39;t care how you manage the data in
the database, all it requires is access to CSV.</p>
<h3 id="index">Index</h3>
<p>This is the URL of a CSV document that contains two columns, headed
<code>sheet</code> and <code>url</code>. The <code>sheet</code> column has two entries, <code>roles</code> and
<code>inventory</code>, each of which has a corresponding entry in the URL
column.</p>
<pre><code>sheet, url
roles,http://address-of-roles.csv
inventory,http://address_of_inventory.csv</code></pre><h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
<p>The <code>roles</code> URL points to a CSV document with two columns, <code>role</code> and
<code>list</code>.  The <code>role</code> column gives the name of a role e.g. <code>member</code> and
the <code>list</code> column gives a comma-separated list of people who can
perform that role.  There must be at least the following columns:</p>
<ol>
<li>member - club members who are permitted to borrow equipment</li>
<li>operator - qualified compressor operators</li>
</ol>
<p>Other lists may be provided in additional columns for future use. Example:</p>
<pre><code>role,list
member,&quot;Freddie Mercury,Abraham Lincoln,Nikola Tesla,Sun Tzu&quot;
operator,&quot;Abraham Lincoln,Sun Tzu&quot;
blender,&quot;Sun Tzu&quot;
trainee,&quot;Freddie Mercury&quot;</code></pre><h3 id="inventory-1">Inventory</h3>
<p>The <code>inventory</code> entry in the index is the URL of another CSV document
that has <code>sheet</code> and <code>url</code> columns. This time the rows correspond to a
tab in the inventory, and the URL is of another sheet that provides
the columns for that tab. For example,</p>
<pre><code>sheet,url
Cylinders,http://url-of-cylinders.csv
Regulators,http://url-of-rgeulators-csv</code></pre><p>It&#39;s up to what columns you put in your inventory. An example for a
<code>Cylinders</code> sheet might be:</p>
<pre><code>ID,Description,Location,Kit Pool
01,Yellow 12L,Cage,Training,
04,Blue pony 3,Cage,Qualified</code></pre><p>Two columns are special in these sheets, <code>Location</code> and <code>Kit
Pool</code>. These columns are included in the top-level <code>Inventory</code> tab but
are ignored in the inventory pick dialog on the <code>Loans</code> tab.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-the-database">Setting up the database</h3>
<p>There are a number of ways you can manage the database. The simplest
would be to have a number of CSV format files that you manually
edit. Slightly more functional is to publish sheets from spreadsheets
in Google Drive. Or you could create an application (e.g. using PHP)
that would serve the required CSV from your existing database.</p>
<p>Hartford Sub-Aqua Club uses Google Drive. We use proxy spreadsheets to
extract data from the core databases (which are themselves spreadsheets)
using <code>IMPORTRANGE</code>. The proxy sheets are then published as CSV. This
approach gives us fine-grained control over what data enters the public
domain.</p>
